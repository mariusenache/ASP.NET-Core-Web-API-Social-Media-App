# ASP.NET Social Media Backend Project

This is my first project where I learn about the backend:

- Wep API application, using C# and ASP.NET Core framework.; 
- authentication and authorization sets up using JWT authentication;
- configured a SQL Server database connection
- set up Swagger/OpenAPI for API documentation.
- connected to local Database
